**DATE: 13-11-2024** <br>
**NAME : KISHORE N**<br>
**REGISTER NUMBER : 212222240049**

### Aim:
Design a decision tree for following data. 
Healthy, In Cover, With Ammo -> Attack
Hurt, In Cover, With Ammo -> Attack
Healthy, In Cover, Empty -> Defend
Hurt, In Cover, Empty -> Defend
Hurt, Exposed, With Ammo -> Defend

### Algorithm:

1. Start the program
2. import the necessary packages 
3. Design a training data and test data 
4. Create a decision tree classifier model
5. Output the predictions 
6. Visualize the decision tree
   
### Program:

```py
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn import tree
import pandas as pd
# Data: [Health, Cover, Ammo, Exposed]
# Health: 1 for Healthy, 0 for Hurt
# Cover: 1 for In Cover, 0 for Exposed
# Ammo: 1 for With Ammo, 0 for Empty
# Exposed: 1 for Exposed, 0 for In Cover
# Actions: 0 for Defend, 1 for Attack
# Define the training data and corresponding labels (actions)
data = [
    [1, 1, 1],  # Healthy, In Cover, With Ammo -> Attack
    [0, 1, 1],  # Hurt, In Cover, With Ammo -> Attack
    [1, 1, 0],  # Healthy, In Cover, Empty -> Defend
    [0, 1, 0],  # Hurt, In Cover, Empty -> Defend
    [0, 0, 1],  # Hurt, Exposed, With Ammo -> Defend
]
# Labels: 1 for Attack, 0 for Defend
labels = [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
# Create a Decision Tree Classifier model
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion="entropy")
# Train the model
clf.fit(data, labels)
# Make predictions (example data points)
test_data = [
    [1, 1, 1],  # Healthy, In Cover, With Ammo
    [0, 0, 1],  # Hurt, Exposed, With Ammo
    [1, 1, 0],  # Healthy, In Cover, Empty
]
# Predict actions for the test data
predictions = clf.predict(test_data)
# Output the predictions
for i, pred in enumerate(predictions):
    action = "Attack" if pred == 1 else "Defend"
    print(f"Test case {i+1}: Predicted action is {action}")
# Optional: Visualize the decision tree
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
tree.plot_tree(clf, feature_names=['Health', 'Cover', 'Ammo', 'Exposed'], class_names=['Defend', 'Attack'], filled=True)
plt.show()

### Result:
Thus the decision tree is designed for the given data.
